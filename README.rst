``csv23`` provides the unicode-based API of the Python 3 ``csv`` module for
Python 2 and 3. Code that should run under both versions of Python can use it
to hide the ``bytes`` vs. ``text`` difference between 2 and 3 and stick to the
newer unicode-based interface.

It uses ``utf-8`` as default encoding everywhere.


Improvements
------------

``csv23`` works around for the following bugs in the stdlib ``csv`` module:

bpo-12178_
  broken round-trip with ``escapechar`` if your data contains a literal escape
  character

bpo-31590_
  broken round-trip with ``escapechar`` and embedded newlines under Python 2
  (fixed in Python 3.4 but not backported): produce a warning

Extras
------

The package also provides some convenience functionality such as the
``open_csv()`` context manager for opening a CSV file in the right mode and
returning a ``csv.reader`` or ``csv.writer``:

.. code:: python

    >>> import csv23

    >>> with csv23.open_csv('spam.csv') as reader:  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     for row in reader:
    ...         print(', '.join(row))
    Spam!, Spam!, Spam!'
    Spam!, Lovely Spam!, Lovely Spam!'


Python 3 Extras
---------------

The ``read_csv()`` and ``write_csv()`` functions (available on Python 3 only)
are most useful if you want (or need to) open a file-like object in the calling
code, e.g. when reading or writing directly to a binary stream such as a ZIP
file controlled by the caller (emulated with a ``io.BytesIO`` below):

.. code:: python

    >>> import io
    >>> buf = io.BytesIO()

    >>> import zipfile
    >>> with zipfile.ZipFile(buf, 'w') as z, z.open('spam.csv', 'w') as f:
    ...     csv23.write_csv(f, [[1, None]], header=['spam', 'eggs'])
    <zipfile...>

    >>> buf.seek(0)
    0

    >>> with zipfile.ZipFile(buf) as z, z.open('spam.csv') as f:
    ...     csv23.read_csv(f, as_list=True)
    [['spam', 'eggs'], ['1', '']]

``csv23`` internally wraps the byte stream in a ``io.TextIOWrapper`` with the
given encoding and ``newline=''`` (see ``csv`` module docs_).

The ``write_csv()``-function also supports updating objects with a
``.update(<bytes>)``-method such as ``hashlib.new()`` instances, which allows
to calculate a checksum over the binary CSV file output produced from the given
rows without writing it to disk (note that the object is returned):

.. code:: python

    >>> import hashlib

    >>> csv23.write_csv(hashlib.new('sha256'), [[1, None]], header=['spam', 'eggs']).hexdigest()
    'aed6871f9ca7c047eb55a569e8337af03fee508521b5ddfe7ad0ad1e1139980a'

Both functions have an optional ``autocompress`` argument: Set it to ``True``
to transparently compress (or decompress) if the file argument is a path that
ends in one of ``'.bz2'``, ``'.gz'``, and ``'.xz'``.


Installation
------------
